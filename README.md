Observer design for a energy shaping and damping injection control law

1. OpenLoopSimulation.m

In this code we simulate the vibrating string in open loop. At the left
side the velocity is zero and the the right side the force is zero.

2. DampingInjection.m

In this code we simulate the closed-loop system under a damping injection
control law. In this case, u = -Ky.
